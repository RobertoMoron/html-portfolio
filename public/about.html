<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Roberto Moron, a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in Data Science.<br /> 
  Passionate about technology and its transformative power, I'm eager to gain hands-on experience in the<br /> 
  field of software engineering.</p>

<p>During my time at UC Berkeley, I honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, diving deep into the<br /> 
  world of computer science and statistics. My education has equipped me with a solid foundation in data<br />  
  structures, algorithms, and machine learning techniques.</p>

<p>In the short term, my goal is to secure a software engineering role where I can apply my technical<br />  
  knowledge and continue learning from experienced professionals. I am eager to contribute my skills<br /> 
  to a team that shares my passion for innovation and growth.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I have long-term aspirations of achieving financial independence by venturing into<br />  
  entrepreneurship. I aim to create meaningful solutions that address real-world challenges and have<br />  
  a positive impact on people's lives.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me exploring the great outdoors<br />  
  through hiking trails, seeking culinary adventures at new restaurants, and embarking on exciting<br /> 
  travel experiences. As a fan of hip-hop music, I enjoy critically analyzing rap songs, delving into<br />  
  their lyrics and deciphering the creative expressions within.</p>  

 <p>Thank you for visiting my page, and I invite you to connect with me to explore potential collaborations<br />  
  or simply share your insights. Together, let's embrace diversity, drive innovation, and make a positive<br />  
  impact on the world through technology.</p>
